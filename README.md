# PyTeN
# Python library for Tensor Network calculations (mostly MPS)



PyTeN can be used to calculate ground-states and do real time evolution
of 1d quantum systems. 


## finite systems:

* ground states using DMRG
* Real time evolution using TEBD

## infinite systems

* ground states for translationally invariant systems using gradient optimization
* ground states for systems with finite unit-cells using IDMRG

the examples folder contains three examples of how to use it
